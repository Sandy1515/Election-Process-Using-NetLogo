# Election-Process-Using-NetLogo
Many countries around the world, use a run-off between the top two candidates, and the leader of the first round may not make it through the second round. This model is an instant run-off election with only a second preference vote. We use NetLogo Application, wwhich is a 'Multi-agent programmable modelling environment'. (read README)
NetLogo is based on the concept of patches. We will assume that each patch represents a contituency. Each constituency will have N candidates, the number of which will vary at runtime. 
Each voter will vote twice. The first vote will be for any one candidate, and the second one for any other candidate.
For the sake of simplicity, voting will be random. However, we will configure the preferred candidates, who will have double the chance of getting a vote.

In the model(once coded....)
.... the Setup button initialises the model. The GO button counts the votes and shows the results based on the first preference votes. The button for 'processing' the second preference votes will display the result (after the second preference votes have been processed)
